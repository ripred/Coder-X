# Coder-X Python Agentic Coding Assistant - Project Plan

---

## ðŸ›‘ Primary Project Rules & Workflow Discipline

**These rules MUST be followed for every feature, bugfix, and code change. They are non-negotiable and are critical for project health and AI-assist reliability.**

1. **Documentation & Tracking**
   - `plan.md`, `architecture_and_maintenance.md`, `requirements.txt`, and all other project, bug tracking, and feature tracking files MUST be kept up to date with every significant change or success.
   - When a feature or bug is completed, immediately update all relevant documentation and remove obsolete/completed issues from tracking files.
   - Never leave documentation or tracking out of sync with the actual codebase.

2. **Testing Discipline**
   - Every new feature, bugfix, or refactor MUST include at least one relevant unit test.
   - Unit tests must always exercise real, production code paths (not just mocks or stubs).
   - After any change, **run all unit tests** (not just the tests for the current feature) to ensure nothing is broken.
   - Do not proceed to the next step until all tests are passing at 100%.

3. **Commit & Push Policy**
   - Once all tests are passing after a change, immediately commit all changes locally and push to the remote repository.
   - Never leave uncommitted changes or failing tests in the working directory.

## Project Goal & Approach

**Goal:**  
Develop a Python-based, agentic coding assistant modeled after Anthropic's Claude Code. This tool will provide natural language coding assistance, codebase understanding, and workflow automation directly from the terminal. It will support both local and remote models (e.g., Ollama), allow user selection and configuration of models, support the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and enable flexible storage of models on any user-selected drive.

**Approach:**  
- Use Python with CLI for the backend.
- Implement a CLI and interactive shell for user interaction.
- Support model selection (local/remote) and configuration.
- Integrate with MCP for context/memory sharing.
- Allow secure key management.
- Enable model storage on any user-selected location (internal or external drives).
- Modular, extensible, and well-documented codebase.

---

### Claude Code Parity & Feature Comparison

**Current Status:**
- Coder-X implements the core features of Claude Code: interactive CLI, one-off queries, scriptable output, unified configuration, model selection, session/history management, and secure key management.
- Documentation, onboarding, and test coverage are strong.

**Notable Parity Achievements:**
- Interactive REPL and scripting
- Unified config management (Pydantic, Typer)
- Model selection/configuration (Ollama/local/remote)
- Session/history and secure key management
- Modular, extensible subsystems
- Project initialization and onboarding docs

**Partial or Missing Features (Compared to Claude Code):**
- Slash command system (e.g., /clear, /doctor, /help, etc.)
- Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- Usage/cost tracking and reporting
- Health check/doctor command
- Bug reporting from CLI
- Project initialization as a command (/init)
- Memory file editing via CLI
- PR/comments/code review integration
- Terminal/editor integration (key bindings, vim mode)
- Auto-update mechanism

---

### Roadmap to Full Parity

To match the full feature set and experience of Claude Code, prioritize:
1. Implementing a robust slash command system for in-session runtime actions.
2. Completing MCP integration for project/user/global memory sharing.
3. Adding usage/cost tracking and reporting.
4. Introducing a health check/doctor CLI command.
5. Enabling bug reporting from the CLI.
6. Creating a project initialization command (/init) for onboarding.
7. Supporting memory file editing through the CLI.
8. Integrating with PR/comments and code review tools.
9. Adding terminal/editor integration features.
10. Providing an update mechanism for Coder-X.

---

**Summary:**  
Coder-X is well on its way to achieving parity with Anthropic's Claude Code, with all core features implemented and a clear roadmap for closing remaining gaps. This plan ensures Coder-X remains robust, user-friendly, and competitive as an agentic coding assistant.

## Task Breakdown

---

- Once tests pass, clean up the test code and update documentation as needed.

---

## Testing and Configuration Philosophy

- All tests must exercise real, production code paths (not just mocks or stubs).
- Features must work the same way at runtime and in testsâ€”tests should not bypass or mock out core logic.
- Configuration loading and saving must be unified: the same config file must work identically in both runtime and test contexts.
- If the config loader or CLI/API code falls back to defaults or overwrites fields, this must be refactored so that valid files are always honored as-is.
- Coverage and test quality are prioritized over simply "passing" tests.

## Tracked Steps: In Progress


## Basic Features: Status Summary

All core features (model management, storage, shell integration, config, session/history, user management, MCP, key management, file operations) are now implemented, tested, and documented. Unit tests (see test_cli_new.py and other current tests) cover all validation and error-handling logic. Documentation is up to date in plan.md and architecture_and_maintenance.md. Legacy and redundant tests have been removed for clarity.

## Best Practices & Design Decisions

- Use Ollama for local models; fallback to `llama-cpp-python` or `transformers` if needed.
- Secure, encrypted key storage.
- Model storage location is user-configurable and can be any attached drive.
- All config changes available via CLI, shell, and config file.
- Modular code for easy extension and maintenance.

---

## Project-wide Testing Requirement

- **Every implementation step must include at least one unit test.**
- After each step and its associated test(s) are implemented, all unit tests must be run to:
  - Verify the new functionality is correct.
  - Ensure no existing functionality is broken (non-regression).
- The project will not proceed to the next step until all tests pass.
- **Before running any test that downloads or uses a local model, always prompt the user to select which volume to use for model storage to avoid disk space issues or using the wrong drive.**
- **Defer the implementation and testing of local model downloading/storage until after remote/free/no-API-key model functionality is implemented and tested successfully.**
- **For each section and step (and its unit test(s)), an accurate section must be added to architecture_and_maintenance.md describing how the step is accomplished. This document must be updated at the same rate as steps are implemented and tested.**
- **All code stubs (placeholders, stub functions/classes, and TODOs) must be fully implemented and tested before the project is considered complete. Stub removal is a tracked deliverable.**

---

## Integration Testing Policy

- All integration/system tests (including those that generate, write, or execute code) **must** run in a temporary, isolated directory. Never run such tests in the user's real project, codebase, or home folder.
- This prevents accidental file creation, overwriting, or clutter in real user directories and is required for safety and reproducibility.
- Integration tests should always clean up after themselves and verify no files are left behind.

## Console Framing Refactor (Claude-style)

- [ ] Add 'rich' as a dependency for console UI.
- [ ] Refactor CLI to render all input/output inside a persistent frame using rich.
- [ ] Refactor interactive shell to use rich framing for all prompts and outputs.
- [ ] Add integration/system tests to ensure all shell/CLI output and input is always inside a frame.
- [ ] Document the framing behavior and test requirements in architecture_and_maintenance.md.
- [ ] Mark as required for all future features and output improvements.

## Remaining Steps for Project Completion

- [ ] Implement and test telemetry (remove stubs in `app/feedback_telemetry.py`)
- [ ] Implement and test third-party integrations (remove stubs in `app/third_party_integrations.py`)
- [ ] **Final audit:** Remove all stubs, placeholders, and TODOs; ensure 100% implementation and test coverage
- [ ] Plan and begin next-phase improvements (output/UX, new features, etc.)
