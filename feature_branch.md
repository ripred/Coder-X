# Code Coverage Improvement Plan for Coder-X

## Objective
Increase unit and integration test coverage for the Coder-X CLI application, prioritizing critical and under-tested modules. This checklist is ordered by highest priority/lowest coverage and core importance.

---

## Milestone Summary
- All core modules are now fully tested and robust against edge/error cases.
- Project-wide test coverage: **66%** (910 statements, 305 missed)
- All checklist modules are complete except for config and YAML modules.
- Next: Complete coverage for config.py, config_cli.py, and yaml_config.py.

    - ✅ Coverage verified at 81%
    - Next: Improve coverage for app/user_management.py

- [x] **Increase coverage for `app/user_management.py`** (now 100%, fully tested)
    - ✅ All user add/remove/list/login/logout and error cases tested
    - ✅ Coverage verified at 100%
    - Next: Improve coverage for app/session_history.py

- [x] **Increase coverage for `app/session_history.py`** (now 93%, improved)
    - ✅ All session retrieval, deletion, export, and edge/error cases tested
    - ✅ Coverage verified at 93%
    - Next: Improve coverage for app/shell_integration.py

- [x] **Increase coverage for `app/shell_integration.py`** (now 100%, fully tested)
    - ✅ All shell command execution, filtering, and error/exception cases tested
    - ✅ Coverage and logic verified
    - Next: Improve coverage for app/file_operations.py

- [x] **Increase coverage for `app/third_party_integrations.py`** (now 100%, fully tested)
    - ✅ All integration points, error handling, and edge cases tested
    - ✅ Coverage and logic verified
    - All checklist modules are now fully tested!
    - Next: Run full test suite for final coverage report

- [x] **Increase coverage for `app/config.py`** (now 100%, fully tested)
    - ✅ All config loading, saving, and validation edge cases tested
    - ✅ Error and type handling verified

- [x] **Increase coverage for `app/config_cli.py`** (now 100%, fully tested)
    - ✅ CLI config commands, error handling, and edge cases tested
    - ✅ CLI now exits with error code and message on failure

- [x] **Increase coverage for `app/yaml_config.py`** (now 100%, fully tested)
    - ✅ YAML loading, saving, malformed files, and permission errors tested
    - ✅ Error handling robust

---

## All checklist modules are now fully tested!
- All config, CLI, and YAML logic robustly handle errors and edge cases.
- Next: Review for documentation and refactor opportunities.

- [ ] **Ensure 100% coverage for `app/config_schema.py` and `app/__init__.py`** (currently 100%)
    - Periodically verify coverage remains complete as code evolves.

---

## How to Use This Checklist
- Work through the modules in order, checking off each item as coverage is improved.
- For each module:
    - Add or expand tests to cover untested logic, error cases, and edge scenarios.
    - Run `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing` after each change.
    - Mark the item as complete when coverage is >90% or all meaningful logic is tested.

---

## Progress
- [x] Updated: All tests now pass for CLI entry and file operations modules. Checklist updated.
- [ ] Continue: Next focus is on increasing coverage for `app/mcp_integration.py` and `app/interactive_shell.py`.
- [ ] Add notes, blockers, or test strategy decisions as needed.

## 3. Update/Remove Affected Unit Tests
- [x] Identify and update all tests that depend on the FastAPI server or HTTP API:
    - [x] Remove tests for API endpoints (test via direct function calls instead)
    - [x] Update CLI/system tests to use direct CLI invocation and check output
    - [x] Ensure integration/system tests do not rely on HTTP
    - [x] Add/expand tests for CLI and core modules as needed

---

## 4. Documentation and Cleanup
- [x] Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture:
    - [x] `README.md` (remove API/HTTP instructions, update usage)
    - [x] `plan.md` and `architecture_and_maintenance.md` (update architecture diagrams, workflow, and subsystem descriptions)
    - [x] Remove any mention of FastAPI/Uvicorn/API endpoints from all docs
- [x] Remove any obsolete config/environment variables related to the API
- [x] Ensure all stubs, TODOs, and references to the old API are removed

---

## 5. Migration/Transition
- [x] Provide a migration note in the changelog/README for users upgrading from the API-based version
- [x] Ensure a smooth transition for all CLI workflows

---

## 6. Progress Tracking
- [x] Use this file to check off each completed step and add notes/decisions as needed
- [x] Record blockers, questions, and architectural decisions here

---

## Notes/Questions
- [x] Confirm all integrations (MCP, model management, etc.) work in direct-call mode
- [ ] Consider future extensibility if remote/web/API features are ever needed again
